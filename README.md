# Revenue Calculator

The `revenue-calculator` project is designed to calculate profits from stock trading operations across years, considering currency exchange rate differences for transactions. Currently, the project supports converting trading operations from USD to profits in EUR.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two microservices:

1. **core-service**: Handles profit calculations.
2. **files-upload-service**: Manages the upload of files in the QIT (Quick Input Transactions) format.

## API Endpoints

TBD.
